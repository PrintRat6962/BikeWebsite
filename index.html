                    Hello, and welcome to this website I made on my journey towards learning HTML and CSS. 
                    While there are links and buttons scattered all over this page, I'm sorry to say that
                    they won't do much as this is only a site that existed for learning. However, I hope this 
                    doesn't stop you from exploring and playing around here.
                </p>

                    To be honest, I don't have that much experience with bikes (other than being able to ride them.)

                <p>
                    One day I want to do a triathalon. But would it be weird to say that the bike portion holds me back?
                </p>
                <p>-Also me</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tbox">
                <p>
                    I don't have a bike myself even though I think it would be cool to have one.
                </p> 
                <p>-Another fact about me</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tbox">
                <p>
                    I don't know what to put here as I believe three statements about myself and bikes is sufficient
